The body of a simple macro with a dropdown selection is:

!DeclaredInitiative ?{Action Type|&#x2694 Melee|&#x1F3F9 Missile|&#x1F52E Magic|&#x1F527 Other}


The body of a macro with a dropdown selection as well as a query for init bonus (useful for skills like Quick Draw):

!DeclaredInitiative ?{Action Type|&#x2694 Melee|&#x1F3F9 Missile|&#x1F52E Magic|&#x1F527 Other} ?{Bonus|0}

To sort easily (you could just sort from clicking, up to you), macro: !SortInitiative

To clear easily (again, you could just click), macro: !ClearInitiative

Here's the body of a menu macro I use:

/w gm &{template:5eDefault}  {{title=Initiative}} {{subheader=}} {{freetext=[Initiative](!&#13;#Initiative)
[Sort](!SortInitiative)
[Clear](!ClearInitiative)}}

Finally, while I ruled in my game that 2 handed weapons don't make you lose individual initiative, I added that functionality
in case you rule otherwise. Replace the 2 initiative macros with these:

!DeclaredInitiative ?{Action Type|&#x2694 Melee|&#x1F3F9 Missile|&#x1F52E Magic|&#x1F932 2Hander|&#x1F527 Other} ?{Bonus|0}

!DeclaredInitiative ?{Action Type|&#x2694 Melee|&#x1F3F9 Missile|&#x1F932 2Hander|&#x1F52E Magic|&#x1F527 Other}
