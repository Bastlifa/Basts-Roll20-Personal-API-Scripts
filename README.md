# Roll20-Personal-API-Scripts
A Collection of some of the API Scripts I wrote for use with Roll20.

Many were left out for being either too niche, using content I've no right to distribute, or being simply too crummy.

The scripts are separated into folders according to game system. 
Instructions are either obvious, or in the comments, or I neglected them.
