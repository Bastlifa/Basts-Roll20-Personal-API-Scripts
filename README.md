# Roll20-Personal-API-Scripts
A Collection of some of the API Scripts I wrote for use with Roll20.

I've been learning js from w3schools, MDN, stackexchange, and other people's code.
I'm sure much of this is horrible to look upon, but it's the fumblings of a starting scripter.

Many were left out for being either too niche, using content I've no right to distribute, or being simply too crummy.

The scripts are separated into folders according to game system. 
Instructions are either obvious, or in the comments, or I neglected them.

Please let me know if you're unsure how any of these work, or if you encounter a bug.
